This is a basic Discord bot that I developed to help test features that I would later implement into different applications.
It can talk to a Postgres server using psycopg2, and uses that information to display the current shop or any shop from a date I've previously logged.
It uses the BomblinePCs/ folder to size up the list and display the cards. 
Not sure how much more I will be developing this, as it was mostly a testing project.
