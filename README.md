The Redfor bot is a condensed verison of the official website, ported to discord. (Website not public yet.)
Equipped with the ability to get information about specific playercards, any shop date ever logged, and more, Redfor bot is a great way to quickly view information from just a discord channel. 
Redfor bot will be updated with new features and better quality playercards until I just don't want to maintain it anymore. The main priority is redfor.org!
